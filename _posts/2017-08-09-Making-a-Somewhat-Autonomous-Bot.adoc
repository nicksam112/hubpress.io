== Background
For my internship at Booz Allen Hamilton, one of my tasks was to find a way to navigate a robot with a sensor package mounted on it throughout a building. The problem? We couldn't modify the existing building infrastructure, so no guiding magnets or painting lines, and it had to be done cheaply.

With a budget of only a few thousand for the entire project, and the interior robot being only a third of the overall solution, there wasn't a lot of wiggle room.

The solution we came up with? A roomba, a rasberry pi, and deep learning.

== The Solution

We settled on a roomba due to a few reasons, it was cheap (about 200 bucks), it was large enough to mount plenty of sensors, and it was easy enough to control with a raspberry pi.

Our shopping list consisted of:

* Roomba
* Serial to USB cable
* Raspberry Pi
* Cheapest webcome we could find

Total cost was about 300 bucks, now came the question of how to actually make it autonomous. I ultimately decided on a visual based
